Here is my CODSOFT internship task that I have completed.
In this task , I make a predictive system to make a prediction that how many survived or not.
In this project I use the python language , first I collect the data from Kaggle website then process this data such as remove the unwanted information , replaces the null value try to analyze the insights from this data by using the visulization . After that I train and test the data using logistic regression model.Then I do evaluation report.
